# Movie_Recommender_System

In this experiment, I have built two different models of a movie recommender system, inspired by the following papers:

http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2012/BaoXia-MovieRatingEstimationAndRecommendation_FinalWriteup.pdf
https://grouplens.org/site-content/uploads/Item-Based-WWW-2001.pdf

using the data downloaded from the following site:

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

after which I compute the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for each model.

To run, open Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb in iPython notebook.
